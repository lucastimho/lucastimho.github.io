				<h3>Entering college</h3>
				<p>Coming into college I was uncertain what field I wanted to study in. I knew I wanted to pursue STEM and that
					led to healthcare. During undergrad, I learned multiple skills and accomplished more goals than I had imagined
					was possible for me at the time. I earned a 70th percentile and 56th percentile on my pharmacy and medical
					school admissions exams respectively, I had a journal article in the process of publication, and I graduated
					college with a 3.8 GPA in the second hardest degree on campus, biochemistry. Sadly, I was declined acceptance
					into medical school and pursued further by reapplying.
				</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
						<h3>My gap year after college</h3>
						<p>To bolster my application and improve my knowledge of the field, I worked multiple healthcare jobs. The
							first job I explored was working as a patient care technician. This was where I was able to work alongside
							nurses at the hospital. While the job was rewarding, I found the job physically taxing on my body and knew
							nursing was not a career I could envision myself doing. Then, I revisited the idea of pursuing pharmacy
							school and worked as a pharmacy technician. The job felt straightforward but I could not see much
							fulfillment in the job that I had working alongside nurses. Finally, I worked as a medical scribe at a
							urology clinic. It was a thrilling place to work as I got to learn many medical conditions and ways to
							treat them. I had high hopes working this job that becoming a doctor was I would pursue.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
						<h3>My decision going forward</h3>
						<p>Then one issue became more apparent as I worked longer at the urology clinic. The healthcare system and
							its heavy reliance on health insurance dissuaded me from wanting to pursue my goal going forward into
							medicine. When I felt like healthcare was not for me anymore, I took the opportunity when I heard I could
							become a software engineer. I had always enjoyed using my computer and finding ways to customize my
							computer usage. As I look forward, I do not regret the information I learned working in healthcare.
